For the final deliverable we were able to get it to function with depth maps independently.
We were able to generate maps with no gaping holes or problems

We optimized the connections from the teensy and the arduino to optimize the speed at which the program runs.
The teensy runs faster but the uno can output more power and we optimized the connections to draw enough power while having the commands come from the teensy 3.6 which ran at 180Mhz while the Uno ran at 16Mhz to minimize delay.

## Mechanical

For our final design, we wanted to upgrade the look and function of the mechanical system. The first step was to outfit the launcher with an upgraded Nerf gun. We were able to attain another Nerf Stryfe with modifications made to its trigger, motors, flywheels, barrel, and battery. The upgrades made the darts fire with more accuracy, consistency, and speed which would help with the reliability of the entire launcher system. The other major change was the switch from an MDF frame to one made of acrylic. We wanted to create a more slick and elegant look for the pan-tilt mechanism and we felt acrylic was a suitable replacement for MDF. When making our switch to acrylic, we made minor changes to the previous model, such a circular base and various minor dimension changes.
