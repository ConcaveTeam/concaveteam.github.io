<h2>Julian Stone</h2>

<p>
  Julian is a star wars fan.
  He will likely survive an alien invasion by speaking Ewokese.
  Julian is a man of all trades applying himself to both software and mechanical teams.
</p>

<p>
  His learning goals for this project was to apply himself in the mechanical realm to supplement his electrical and computer engineering skills.
  To do this, he worked especially closely with Max and Naomi to make this project happen.
  He could not keep himself from contributing to the firmware in this project though.

<h2>Kawin Nikomborirak</h2>

<p>
  Wise man once said that the universe could be deduced by a grain of sand.
  Kawin believes that the world can be deduced by a grain of sand and computer vision.
  He thoroughly enjoys his work in his computer environment and churns out programs that are efficient, elegant, and ambitious.
</p>

<p>
  His learning goals for this project are porting his knowledge of OpenCV to C++ from his existing Python experience.
  He also took every excuse to use PCL to process 3-dimensional data in this project.
  To supplement his expertise in software, he worked on a few mechanical design components such as the initial pan-tilt laser mount.

<h2>Max Otoadese</h2>
<p>
  Max is a car nerd and a former NERF gun enthusiast, so he shines in mechanical systems.
  He brings his mechanical experience and hobby ideas into the projects he works on, serving both as an expert mechanical engineer and an educational resource for his teammates.
</p>
</div>

<p>
  His learning goals for this project are to put his ideas into CAD and out of the machine.
  To do this, he has CAD designs for the camera setup and the launcher support.
  He has also been bleeding into the software side by contributing to the firmware.

<h2>Naomi Chiu</h2>

<p>
  Naomi has a best minesweeper time of around 4 minutes on hard mode.
  This says two things: she is patient and does not mind the odds of failure.
  On an unrelated and yet important note, she loves orange.
  She has found a home in fabrication.
</p>

<p>
  Her learning goals for this project are to exercise her skills as a mechanical engineer via fabrication.
  Therefore, she worked especially tightly with Julian and Max to give our project form.
  She also learned more programming best-practices and libraries by peer-programming Kawin and catching bugs.

<h2>Sreekanth Sajjala</h2>

<p>
  Sreekanth lives life at double speed and enjoys learning in his own way which involves watching lectures at quadruple speed and using his clear sense of direction to deep dive into interesting topics.
  His interests are computer architecture, machine learning, and business.
</p>

<p>
  Sreekanth's learning goals were to explore embedded systems by working on the firmware as well as applying machine learning by supplying a depth map via machine learning and monocular vision.
